<h1>Mike Rzucidlo</h1>
<p>I'm currently a Bertelsmann scholar in Deep Learning via <a href="https://www.udacity.com/bertelsmann-tech-scholarships">Udacity technology Scholarship</a> powered by Bertelsmann. In 2018, I was a GwG scholar in Android Development awarded by Udacity & Google. I'm a software engineer with interests and experience in Android app & embedded dev, IoT and deep learning.</p>
<p>Below are sections with descriptions and links to some of my past and current projects.</p>
<p>If you're interested in my work and thoughts, connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikerz">LinkedIn</a> and/or send me an email</p>

<h2>Selected Projects</h1>
<p>I try to spend time every day to learn something new where much of it has come from MOOC projects the past 3-4 years. It ranges from self-driving cars to Android app development to algorithms to now deep learning! I'm trying to be better about documentation here so I'm going through everything to add more notes and visuals where appropriate.</p>
<br>
<h3>Project #1: <a href="./Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html">Traffic Sign Classifier (Self-driving car Nanodegree)</a></h3>
<p>I utilized a homebrew convolutional neural network (CNN) to train on traffic signs to predict the input images using Python, scikit-learn, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib and pickle. The training data was a German traffic sign data set and the test set was U.S. traffic signs. Training achieved 98.6% accuracy by tweaking the hyperparameters and the model was able to identify the traffic signs in the test set. More details can be found in my <a href="./Traffic_Sign_Classifier.html">writeup</a>.</p>
<br>
<h3>Project #2: <a href="./Behavioral_Cloning.html">Behavioral Cloning (Self-driving car Nanodegree)</a></h3>
<p>I utilized a convolutional neural network (CNN) model Nvidia published and I augmented images from the original dataset to train the model using OpenCV, scipy and keras in addition to many of the same libs in Project #1 in which a car was able to drive around a previously unseen track successfully in a simulation. This was a particularly difficult challenge because my sluggish CPU and video resolution. When running the test after training, it was problematic because the model couldn't reliably get a result fast enough and the car would oscillate. Lowering the video resolution minimized the performance issue. It demonstrated how important having a good development environment is to train and test to get a successful result. Note: <i>My reviewer did not face this problem when running my model.</i>More details can be found in my <a href="./Behavioral_Cloning.html">writeup</a>.</p>

<h3>Project #3: <a href="https://github.com/mickrz/OtherInterestingStuff/blob/master/CybercrimeIDTheftAndPrevention.pdf">Cybercrime 101 with a focus on Identity Theft</a></h3>
<p>I researched, wrote and presented this to my flotilla of the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary after a personal experience I had. It was a lot of fun to research and organize this presentation. I probably spent about 80-100 hours on it but I liked how it came together. It's a bit dated now given this area, but much is still relevant. There are some links to videos off of the FTC website that are not linked in the presentation. I've listed them below for reference.</p>

<h3>Project #4: <a href="https://github.com/mickrz/DSAND/blob/master/Project4/Astar.py">A* Algorithm (Data Structures & Algorithms Nanodegree)</a></h3>
<p>The implementation for A* algorithm was required for the final project in this nanodegree. This was one of the many fun ones to do. Conceptually, it is easy to understand since it combines Djikstra and Greedy Best-First-Search. My implementation is probably a little different than is typically done as I used recursion. It seemed appropriate and I reinforced many of the concepts learned in the program. The blue node on the left and the yellow node on the right are the starting and goal nodes respectively. The red nodes are the lowest step cost of the path + the cost of the heuristic function estimating the cost of the cheapest path from said node to the goal. I used Euclidean distance for both distance calculations. Once the goal was reached and no other paths are shortest, then the reconstructed path is returned. This is useful for many applications where a popular one is Google Maps. Now you know why sometimes you have to merge from the rightmost to the leftmost lane on a 4-lane highway. ;)</p>

<h3>Project #5: mewd</h3>
<p>(description only - more details to come...)
This project was born out of my Android Developer Nanodegree Capstone project as a way to give back for the opportunity and gratefulness of receiving my scholarship. I'm  currently developing an app that enables users to enter how they are feeling and what factors are causing that feeling. Also at any point in time, an inspirational quote can be read when a pick-me-up is needed. The app is targeted for everyone, but anyone suffering from mental health issues may find this beneficial for tracking over time and presenting to their health care professional. (Google Play store launch in Q4 2020)</p>
